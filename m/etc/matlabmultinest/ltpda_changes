In this document the changes to the original code are summarised. The reason for these edits is to adapt the algorithm to the LTPDA architecture.

The main difference is the definition and evaluation of the likelihood function. In the original code the likelihood is defined as a function_handle, and to be evaluated it needs the set of data and a numerical parameter set. In LTPDA we only need a parameter set because the data is stored inside the -so called- mfh object.

List of changes per function
————————————————————————————

A) nested_sampler:

- Inputs were changed to

function [logZ, nest_samples, post_samples] = nested_sampler(Nmcmc, Nlive, tolerance, likelihood, prior, verbose, DEBUG, varargin)

- Removed global variables DEbUG and verbose.
- Removed lines 135-140. They correspond to the extra parameters that do not apply to our implementation.
- Changed i,j,k for-loop indices to ii, jj, and kk respectively.
- Changed call of draw_multinest to 

[livepoints(idx, :), logL(idx)] = draw_multinest(fracvol, Bs, mus, logLmin, prior, flike, DEBUG);  

- Changed call of draw_mcmc to

[livepoints(idx, :), logL(idx)] = draw_mcmc(livepoints, cholmat, ...
              logLmin, prior, flike, Nmcmc, Nsloppy, ...
              covfrac, diffevfrac, walkfrac, stretchfrac);

- 

B) draw_mcmc:

- Inputs were changed to 

function [sample, logL] = draw_mcmc(livepoints, cholmat, logLmin, prior, likelihood, Nmcmc, verbose) 

- Removed global verbose variable. 
- Changed likelihood evaluation to logLnew = likelihood(sc);  

c) optimal_ellipsoids:

- Removed global DEBUG flag
- Added DEBUG flag parameter as input

D) draw_multinest:

- Changed inputs to 

function [sample, logL] = draw_multinest(fracvol, Bs, mus, logLmin, prior, likelihood, DEBUG)

- Removed global DEBUG flag.
- Changed line 63,64 to logL = likelihood(rescaledpnt);
