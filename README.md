# LTPDA toolbox
Davide Dal Bosco's version of the LISA Technology Package Data Analysis (LTPDA for friends) toolbox.

**May 2024**

I updated the Java libraries in the ``jar`` folder to the most recent I could find. This includes the MySQL connector. I had to modify the LTPDA routines that manage the database connection and queries to make them work with the new libraries. 

The neat part is that all the code remains compatible with the older generations of MySQL.
