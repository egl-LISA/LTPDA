% TSDATA time-series object class constructor.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% DESCRIPTION: TSDATA time-series object class constructor.
%              Create a time-series data object. If the time-series object
%              is determined to be evenly sampled, no x vector is stored.
%
% SUPER CLASSES: data2D < ltpda_data < ltpda_nuo < ltpda_obj
%
% CONSTRUCTORS:
%
%       ts = tsdata()        - creates a blank time-series object
%       ts = tsdata(y)       - creates a time-series object with the given
%                              y-data. The data are assumed to be evenly
%                              sampled at 1Hz.
%       ts = tsdata(x,y)     - creates a time-series object with the given
%                              (x,y)-data. The sample rate is then set using
%                              the static method fitfs(). This computes the
%                              best sample rate that fits the data. If the
%                              data is evenly sampled, the sample rate is set
%                              as 1/median(diff(x)) and the x data is then
%                              not stored (empty vector).
%       ts = tsdata(y,fs)    - creates a time-series object with the given
%                              y-data. The data is assumed to be evenly sampled
%                              at the given sample rate with the first sample
%                              assigned time 0. No x vector is created.
%       ts = tsdata(y,t0)    - creates a time-series object with the given
%                              y-data. The data are assumed to be evenly
%                              sampled at 1Hz. The first sample is assumed to
%                              be at 0s offset from t0 and t0 is set to the
%                              user specified value.
%       ts = tsdata(x,y,fs)  - creates a time-series object with the given
%                              x/y data vectors. The sample rate is set to
%                              fs.
%       ts = tsdata(x,y,t0)  - creates a time-series object with the given
%                              x/y data vectors. The t0 property is set to
%                              the supplied t0 and the sample rate is
%                              computed from the x vector using the static
%                              method fitfs(). If the data is found to be
%                              evenly sampled, the x vector is discarded.
%       ts = tsdata(y,fs,t0) - creates a time-series object with the given
%                              y-data. The data are assumed to be evenly
%                              sampled at fs and the t0 property is set to
%                              the supplied t0. No x vector is generated.
%       ts = tsdata(x,y,fs,t0)-creates a time-series object with the given
%                              x-data, y-data, fs and t0.
