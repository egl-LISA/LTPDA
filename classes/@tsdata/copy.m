% DESCRIPTION: COPY makes a deep copy of the input tsdata objects.
%
% CALL:        b = copy(a, flag)
%
% INPUTS:      a    - input tsdata object
%              flag - 1: make a deep copy, 0: return copies of handles
%
% OUTPUTS:     b - copy of inputs
%
% This is a transparent function and adds no history.
