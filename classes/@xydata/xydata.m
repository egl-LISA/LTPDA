% XYDATA X-Y data object class constructor.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% DESCRIPTION: XYDATA X-Y data object class constructor.
%              Create an X-Y data object.
%
% SUPER CLASSES: data2D < ltpda_data < ltpda_nuo < ltpda_obj
%
% Constructors:
%       xy = xydata()      - creates a blank xy-data object
%       xy = xydata(y)     - creates an xy data object with the given
%                            y-data.
%       xy = xydata(x,y)   - creates an xy-data object with the given
%                            (x,y)-data.
