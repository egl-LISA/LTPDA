% FPSDER performs the numeric time derivative
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% DESCRIPTION: FPSDER (Five Points Stencil Derivative) performs the numeric
% time derivative using the method of five points stencil.
% The function can perform first, second, third and fourth derivative
% of a series of input data.
% Given a discrete series of data points, the five-point-stencil method for
% the derivative approximation, at a given time t0, is calculated by means
% of finite differences between the element at t0 with its four neighbors.
% The n-order derivative at a certain time can be approximated by a five
% point difference equation:
%
% d^{n}y[k]
% --------- = (1/T^n) * {a*y[k-2] + b*y[k-1] + c*y[k] + d*y[k+1] + e*y[k+2]}
%  dt^{n}
%
% It can be demonstrated [1,2] that the five coefficients [a, b, c, d, e] can
% be written in terms of only one of them. In fpsder the independent
% coefficient is fixed to be the first and is called m. It can be input as
% a parameter when the function is called.
%
%
% CALL:                 Deriv = fpsder(data, params)
%
% INPUTS:
%
%         - a is a vector containing the data to be differentiated.
%         - params is a struct with the input parameters:
%
%         - 'ORDER' set the derivative order. Its allowed options are:
%             - 'ZERO' perform data smoothing using the coefficients
%             vector d0 = [m -4*m 1+6*m -4*m m].
%             - 'FIRST' perform the first derivative using the
%             couefficients vector d1 = [m -(0.5+2*m) 0 (0.5+2*m) m]./T.
%             Recomended values of m are in the interval [-0.1, 0.1].
%             - 'SECOND' perform the second derivative using the
%             coefficients vector d2 = [m 1-4*m 6*m-2 1-4*m m]./(T^2).
%             Recomended values of m are in the interval [-0.11, 0.3].
%             - 'THIRD' perform the third derivative using the
%             coefficients vector d3 = []./(T^3)
%             - 'FOURTH' perform the third derivative using the
%             coefficients vector d4 = []./(T^4)
%
%         - 'COEFF' set m coefficient values.
%           In case of data smoothing: m = -3/35 correspond to the
%           parabolic fit approximation.
%           In case of first order derivative: m = -1/5 correspond to the
%           parabolic fit approximation, m = 1/12 correspond to the
%           Taylor series approximation.
%           In case of second order derivative: m = 2/7 corresponds to
%           the parabolic fit approximation, m = -1/12 corresponds to the
%           Taylor series approximation and m = 1/4 gives the notch
%           feature at the Nyquist frequency
%
%         - 'FS' set the data sampling frequency in Hz
%
%         NOTE1: T is the sampling period
%         NOTE2: The default option for 'ORDER' is 'SECOND'
%         NOTE3: The default option for 'COEFF' is 2/7
%         NOTE4: The default option for 'FS' is 10
%
% OUTPUTS:
%           - D is a vector containing the resulting data after the
%           differentiation procedure
