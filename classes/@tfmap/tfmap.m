% DESCRIPTION: TFMAP time-frequency data object class constructor.
%
% SUPER CLASSES: xyzdata < data3D < data2D < ltpda_data < ltpda_nuo < ltpda_obj
%
% CONSTRUCTORS:
%       tf = tfmap()      - creates an empty tfmap object
%       tf = tfmap(z)     - creates a tfmap object with the given
%                              z-data.
%       tf = tfmap(x,y,z)  - creates a tfmap object with the given
%                              (x,y,z)-data.
%
% SEE ALSO: tsdata, fsdata, xydata, cdata, data2D, data3D, xyzdata
