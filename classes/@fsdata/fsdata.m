% FSDATA frequency-series object class constructor.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% DESCRIPTION: FSDATA frequency-series object class constructor.
%              Create a frequency-series data object.
%
% SUPER CLASSES: data2D < ltpda_data < ltpda_nuo < ltpda_obj
%
% CONSTRUCTORS:
%
%       fsd = fsdata()        - creates a blank frequency-series object
%       fsd = fsdata(y)       - creates a frequency-series object with the given
%                               y-data. Sample rate of the data is assumed to
%                               be 1Hz.
%       fsd = fsdata(f,y)     - creates a frequency-series object with the given
%                               (x,y)-data. The sample rate is then set as
%                               2*x(end).
%       fsd = fsdata(y,fs)    - creates a frequency-series object with the given
%                               y-data and sample rate. The frequency
%                               vector is grown assuming the first y
%                               sample corresponds to 0Hz and the last
%                               sample corresponds to the Nyquist
%                               frequency.
%       fsd = fsdata(x,y,fs) - creates a frequency-series object with the given
%                               x,y-data and sample rate.
